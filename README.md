# CurryOn
A platform built in F# for creating modern, highly scalable Enterprise applications based on Domain-Driven Design and the CQRS architectural pattern, including a Bus for hosting Sagas (business processes) to handle associated Commands and Events.  The  implementation leverages Akka.net for internal message processing, but all functionality is defined by interfaces, and a simple Dependency Injection system and provides implementations of the interfaces without any direct coupling.  The default technologies used to implement the interfaces include MSMQ (for sending commands), EventStore (for aggregate persistene and publishing events), and ElasticSearch (for query segregation), but the interfaces are technology-agnostic and a wide variety of transport and persistence implementations are possible.  Message serialization can be done using XML, JSON, BSON, or Binary, with compatibility for WCF messages and Flat-Files (positional or delimited); including automatic compression and decompression of large messages.  The CurryOn Saga Bus and associated libraries enable the rapid development of decoupled business processes spanning multiple systems or composed of independent microservices while offering centralized monitoring and simple search functionality for all enterprise data.
