# CurryOn
A platform built in F# for creating modern, highly scalable Enterprise applications based on Domain-Driven Design and the CQRS architectural pattern, including a Bus for hosting Sagas.  The default implementation leverages technologies such as MSMQ (for sending commands), EventStore (for aggregate persistene and publishing events), and ElasticSearch (for query segregation), but the interfaces are technology-agnostic and a wide variety of transport and persistence implementations are possible.  Message serialization supports JSON, XML, WCF (binary), and Flat-Files (positional); including automatic compression and decompression of large messages.  The CurryOn Saga Bus and associated libraries enable the rapid development of decoupled business processes spanning multiple systems or composed of independent microservices while offering centralized monitoring and simple search functionality for all enterprise data.
